**Hello !**

This is the actual repository for the executable version of our game : Medieval Delivery Simulator

I've made this game in collaboration with :
- [Skyclem19](https://github.com/Skyclem19)
- [Flavien77169](https://github.com/Flavien77169)
- [InsertNamee](https://github.com/InsertNamee)

How to play it ?
- Download the Zip and extract it in another new folder.
- Then launch the "Broc√©liande.exe" file (yes, the name changed during dev) and Enjoy !

P.S. :
- If the game is too loud you can modify the volume level in game settings.
- This game was made as a 1 week project at our school (89 digital school).
